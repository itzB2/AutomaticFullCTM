# AutomaticFullCTM

it makes making full ctm easier than never before

u feed it an image with sides and an image with no sides it does the rest for you

here's what your gonna do to make it work

clone the repo to any folder in your local disk
then open cmd or command line  then u run this command

u need python to run this

windows
```
python ctm.py <your normal image path> <your abnormal image with no sides path> <your save path (or your export path)> <old block ID> <new block ID> <block metadata>
```
